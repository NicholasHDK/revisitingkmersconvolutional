```

+ As their names suggest, linear.py is for the linear model and nonlinear.py is for nonlinear models.

+ The training datasets can be downloded by running the following command:
```
gdown 1p59ch_MO-9DXh3LUIvorllPJGLEAwsUp # pip install gdown
unzip dnabert-s_train.zip  # unzip the data
```

+ For the evaluation, please use the following command to get the data:
```
gdown 1I44T2alXrtXPZrhkuca6QP3tFHxDW98c # pip install gdown
